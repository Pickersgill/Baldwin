# Hinton and Nowlan's Model for demonstrating the Baldwin Effect

This is a minimal implementation of the model described [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/evolution.htm) intended primarily as supplementary material to
a blog post on https://pickersgill.dev.

An initial experiment is included which demonstrates usage of the model.
